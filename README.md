# Civil service examination Ranking Considering Heteroidentity Quotas

## About the Project
This project automates the ranking process for a Civil service examination considering heteroidentity quotas such as Brown, Disability (PwD), and Indigenous candidates. It utilizes Python to process data from Excel files containing candidate classifications and competition position indexes. The final output is a ranked list of candidates according to specified quotas and competition rules.

## Key Features âœ¨
* **Automated Ranking**: Automatically selects and ranks candidates based on predefined quotas like Brown, Disability (PwD), and Indigenous categories.
* **Data Processing**: Parses and filters candidate data to ensure compliance with competition rules and quotas.
* **Excel Output**: Outputs the final ranked list to an Excel file, preserving original data structure and additional competition information.

## How to Use
1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (`pandas`).
2. Prepare input Excel files:
   - `obj_preliminar.xlsx`: Contains candidate classifications.
   - `positions_index.xlsx`: Contains competition position indexes.
3. Run the script `main.py`.
4. Follow prompts to select competition type and process the ranking.
5. Check the generated Excel file `resultado_preliminar_objetivas_ordenado_cota.xlsx` for the ranked list.

## Requirements ðŸ§°
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: pandas
